Classification is a suite of supervised learning methods that aim to assign a discrete class
label chosen out of a predefined limited set of options (two or more). An example of such
labels is a system that monitors the financial transactions and validates each transaction
for any kind of fraud. The past data is required, which contains regular transactions as
well as fraudulent transactions explicitly stating which data item (or row) is fraudulent.
The possible classes are “fraudulent transaction” or “nonfraudulent transaction.”
